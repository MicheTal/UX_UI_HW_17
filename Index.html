  <div class="AbM">
    <p>I'm a UI/UX designer who is passionate about creating meaningful and user-centered digital experiences. My journey in design began as a curiosity and has grown into a lifetime passion to designing user-friendly interfaces. My design journey is focused on the value of simplicity, consistency, and clarity. Whether it's wire-framing, prototyping, or creating a pixel-perfect interfaces, I pay close attention to detail to provide a smooth user experience. Collaboration is at the heart of my process, and I enjoy working closely with cross-functional teams to translate ideas into compelling design strategies that align with business goals and user needs.</p>
